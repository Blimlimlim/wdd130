      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Fry sauce, to you it is either an ordinary burger joint staple, or somewhat of an oddity.
        Have you ever wondered, "What is the deal with fry sauce?" 
        If you're from a few select western states, you might be surprised to learn that most places don't dip their fries in the iconic sauce.
        I grew up in Idaho where common knowledge was that you dip fries in fry sauce. When I got older I was shocked to learn that not far from my home state, ketchup was mainstream, and I, not them, was the oddity. 
        My website will teach you everything you need to know about fry sauce so that you may also know the reality surrounding this special sauce.</p>  <!-- change this -->

        What is fry sauce?: Fry sauce at its essence is just two ingredients: one part ketchup and two parts mayonnaise mixed until combined. This simple combination makes for an incredibly popular dipping sauce that is most famous for its widespread, fast-food, French fry dipping use in Utah and surrounding areas.
        Who uses fry sauce?: People who have always lived in or near Utah might be surprised to learn that the rest of the world uses all kinds of sauces for their French fries. Ketchup is commonly used by most Americans, and Mayonnaise is common in Europe. With a few exceptions in South America, the ketchup and mayo combo on fries is a traditional Utah practice.
        Why it is great: The two biggest contenders with fry sauce are its very own components, mayonnaise and ketchup. The two are very different sauces. Mayonnaise is almost all fat. It is creamy and complements the simple flavor of the salty fried starch very well much like sour cream and butter on a baked potato. On the other hand, ketchup is almost all sugar which adds a sweet acidic flavor to the fries.

      <h3>History</h3>
      <p>
        Where did it come from?: The oldest reference to a similar sauce comes from a 1900 New Orleans cookbook which has a recipe for “thousand island dressing” made from equal parts mayonnaise and ketchup.
        While we may not know who the first person was to mix ketchup and mayonnaise together, we do know that the combination became popular in Utah. Utah tradition follows that it was invented by Don Carlos Edwards, founder of the Arctic Circle restaurant franchise. Some sources suggest that Edward created it as a burger sauce called “pink sauce” in the 1920s until he opened Arctic Circle where it became a staple and got the name “fry sauce”.

      <h3>Similar Sauces</h3>
      <p>
        Salsa Golf: Salsa golf or Golf sauce is a popular sauce from Argentina. Like fry sauce it is mostly mayonnaise and ketchup, but often has spices mixed in to give it some extra flavor. It might be older than fry sauce as well, being invented sometime in the 1920s.
        Mayochup: Mayochup is just a Heinz marketing name for what is just a basic fry sauce. There isn’t anything particularly unique about it. It was the first in a long, long line of other sauce combinations that all use a similar naming scheme. 
        Thousand Island: Thousand island is primarily used as a dressing. It contains a variety of ingredients such as spices, Worcestershire sauce, and finely chopped herbs and vegetables.
        Marie Rose sauce: Marie Rose sauce is a British cocktail sauce made from mayonnaise, tomatoes or ketchup, and other ingredients.
