    <p>Hi, my name is Michael. I'll let you decide which of those nicknames is real. I'm currently working on majoring in software engineering. I've been going to school here for two years. I hope to learn a lot in this class. I think understanding web design and such will be very useful.   </p>
    <p>Somewhere in the back of my mind I've been interested in web design ever since I learned to right click and hit "inspect" in a website to "delete" elements or replace pictures with different ones. I've always kind of liked messing with things on the technical side. Actually creating or building something is very similar to that but requires more time learning which brings me here. Other hobbies of mine include longboarding, cooking, video games, and more recenlty creating game mods and modding(There is my messing with technical things again).  </p>
